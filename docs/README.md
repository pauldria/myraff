# Why am I here?

I'm running into a problem using just-the-docs, where it doesn't seem to want to read folders starting with an underscore, like **_posts**, which Jekyll totally relies on.

So I am doing all my dev in the **Posts** folder and have a bash script - ``start.sh`` - that copies everything to the _posts folder and runs.
