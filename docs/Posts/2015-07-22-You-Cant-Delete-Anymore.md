Cloud computing is great, and it's fantastic when I set up family and/or friends with stuff like [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive) and they realize that they can completely separate the data from the machine. Separation of responsibilities (i.e. [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)) is the core concept of object-oriented programming, and now it's making its way to the real world.

But as the [Ashley Madison hack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affair-website-ashley-madison-hacked-1437402152) reminded me, in this world nothing will ever be deleted anymore.
