I'm giving a workshop talk at the [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.sites.uchicago.edu/) workshop series at the University of Chicago.

The talk is titled [Fitting Square Pegs in Round Holes with Data](http://harris.uchicago.edu/event/paul-raff-analysis-and-experimentation-microsoft-capp-workshop). It covers just three of the myriad of situations in which we want data in a certain way, yet we can only get data in the format we get it.

Check out the deck and the corresponding R-based example material [here](https://github.com/paulraff/2016CAPP).
