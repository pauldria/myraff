I'm a mathematician. I always have been, and always will be. Over the course of life I have been able to do pretty awesome things by simply being able to understand the way the world works in a mathematical way.

So all of my thoughts and works here will be of my own, and will represent me. But these will be my main points:

* Math isn't the end-all. Specifically, to be a good mathematician this day and age you need to be a decent computer programmer.
* Data science is hot thing, but it's little more than mathematical modeling and a shit-ton of marketing.

But there's going to be a lot of cool math in this blog, too, so join along and learn something new every day.

Specifically, I'm going to be working through my blog during the semesters at the same pace of a normal course, so let's kick open the ol' calculus book and learn together.
