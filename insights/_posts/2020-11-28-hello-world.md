  Ever wonder why you always think there is insufficient documentation?

For 6 years I worked in the Analysis and Experimentation group at Microsoft, colloquially known as ExP. I spent a lot of my time writing documents and documentation.

The most effective documentation I wrote was what I'll call <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">_active documentation_</span>. Specifically, **TryExP** was a bare-bones, do-it-yourself, end-to-end demonstration of how ExP worked. It was effective because anyone could see how it worked, and poke it as much as they wanted. 

This blog post works in exactly the same way - instead of reading a document on how a post makes its way to the blog, I can reference this first one and put it together.
