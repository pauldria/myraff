It's common for a legacy business that is transforming to being data-driven to get caught in the trap of what I call _Vanity Metrics_ - measuring something that has little meaning or relevance to the business but nevertheless looks good when put up on a dashboard or slide deck. 

A clear example I saw of this is [Ion Tiriac's brain-dead tirade on Serena William's physical attributes](https://www.insidehook.com/daily_brief/sports/serena-williams-weight) in the lead-up to the Madrid Open. These are the kind of metrics Ion Tiriac cares about, it appears:

> With all due respect, Serena Williams is 36 [years old] and 90 kilograms, I would like to see something else . . .

This is a clear example of a Vanity Metric:
* **What Ion Tiriac cares about** - youth and slimness (beauty? vanity?) of Madrid Open competitors. 
* **What Ion Tiriac should care about** - competitiveness, ticket sales, sponsorships, and how these are all impacted if Serena Williams is or is not participating in the Madrid Open.

A final warning on Vanity Metrics: as with many data anti-patterns, these have the effect of producing _exactly the opposite_ impact of what is truly intended. Consider, for example, Ion Tiriac's comments resulting in Serena Williams dropping out of the Madrid Open . . .
