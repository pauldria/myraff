# 2020 12 December - WA Covid By Age

Motivated by the Seattle Times' [article on COVID in youth](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/public-health-officials-enlist-youth-to-slow-the-rapid-spread-of-covid-19-among-young-people-in-seattle/), I was stunned by their lack of insight into the situation of COVID by age, indicated by this plot:

So I set about showing how with a little bit of thought and **a focus on an appropriate baseline**, you can visualize the key conclusion more in a much more effective manner.
