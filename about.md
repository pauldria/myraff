        <b>Principal Data Scientist - Clinical Analytics</b>
        <p />
        <p />
        Raff came in at a critical time of the development of <a href="https://payorsolutions.cvshealth.com/insights/next-generation-transform-diabetes-care">Next-Generation Transform Diabetes Care</a> (ngTDC) and immediately took ownership of the technical aspects of the core machine learning models underlying the program.
        <p />
        <p />
        Working alongside Product, Engineering, Sales, and IT, he led a team of 5 Data Scientists to complete the on-time launch of the pilot and the complete Commercial launch, contributing hundreds of millions of dollars of EBIT for CVS Health and providing a solid foundation for how CVS Health and Aetna use data effectively for the management of chronic diseases.

        <b>Applied Reseacher - Supply Chain Optimization</b>
        <p />
        <p />
        Raff's contribution to supply chain optimization at Amazon resulted in $60 million dollars of fulfillment savings for Amazon's network <b><i>in 2012</i></b>. Think about what that means for Amazon today. 
        <p />
        <p />
        He did it through a simple and effective technique coined <b>Global Fulfillment Optimization</b>. Building on the <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8498888B1/en">patented ideas on fulfillment tie-breaking</a>, he worked with other scientists and engineers to reshape and advance Amazon's fulfillment strategies to massive effect.
