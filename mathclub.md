# Meeting 1 - September 15, 2021

What a great initial meeting! I enjoyed meeting all of you and I hope you had fun. We spent a full hour doing countdown round-style math problems.

If you want to review the problems we did with solutions, [go here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cDkJovRiy-_L5imOTblBsryThZUgFzBmjkpvHHBTr4M/edit?usp=drivesdk). It includes a few more problems we didn't have time to get to.

**Remember - our next Math Club meeting isn't until October 6**. We will have consistent weekly sessions after that.
