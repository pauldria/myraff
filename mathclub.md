# Welcome to the Math Club

This page gives all of the details of Math Club at [Jefferson Middle School](https://jms.mtlsd.org/), along with an overview of the different topics and themes we cover each session with my commentary.

# Meeting 3 - October 13, 2021

The meeting topic this week was [**The Fundamental Counting Principle**](https://www.mathcounts.org/resources/fundamental-counting-principle), which covered a lot of areas around how to count things. Check out the video right here:

See you next week, October 20, for the next meeting, where we will cover some geometry questions!

# Meeting 2 - October 6, 2021

We had some A/V issues but they'll be taken care of next time with some extra cables that I purchased. 

The meeting topic this week was [**Faster Arithmetic Methods**](https://www.mathcounts.org/resources/faster-arithmetic-methods), which covered a lot of tips for how you can make slight changes to a problem to make it easier to solve. 

Here's a great simple example: _find (363 + 709) + 637_. The parentheses are tricking you into wanting to add the two numbers first, but if you notice that 363 + 637 = 1000, then you can get the answer (1709) more quickly.

See you next week, October 13, for the next meeting!

# Meeting 1 - September 15, 2021

What a great initial meeting! I enjoyed meeting all of you and I hope you had fun. We spent a full hour doing countdown round-style math problems.

If you want to review the problems we did with solutions, [go here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cDkJovRiy-_L5imOTblBsryThZUgFzBmjkpvHHBTr4M/edit?usp=drivesdk). It includes a few more problems we didn't have time to get to.

**Remember - our next Math Club meeting isn't until October 6**. We will have consistent weekly sessions after that.
