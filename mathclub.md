# Meeting 7 - November 10, 2021

We went over the competition structure and did a practice Team Round. 
* The 2022 Mathcounts Competition is on **Thursday, February 17, 2022**. It will be online, but they are aiming to do a full competition.
* There are four sections of the competition:
  * The **Sprint Round** is individual, 30 questions over 40 minutes. No calculator.
  * The **Target Round** is individual, 4 pairs of 2 questions with 6 minutes per pair. Calculators are allowed.
  * The **Team Round** is team, 10 questions over 20 minutes. Calculators are allowed.
  * The **Countdown Round** is 1-on-1 with the first correct answer advancing to the next mathlete. 45 seconds for each question max, no calculators allowed. 

* [Go here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qg_ykVxlSYjvMKmyE-zMGk1CzZvxdyZyVwCqdveTbeM/edit?usp=sharing) for the slides we covered along with a walkthrough of all the questions that was asked in the [Team Round practice](https://www.brookline.k12.ma.us/cms/lib/MA01907509/Centricity/Domain/573/2018%20School%20Competition%20Complete.pdf).

# Meeting 6 - November 3, 2021

The meeting topic this week was [**Patterns**](https://www.mathcounts.org/resources/representing-patterns-numerically). Either find the pattern one-by-one, or often you'll need to find the formula for the pattern!

# Meeting 5 - October 27, 2021

Instead of probability, we did a mock Sprint Round to assess the students and to give them a glimpse of part of the competition.

Students took the [2018 MATHCOUNTS Sprint Round](https://www.houstonisd.org/cms/lib2/TX01001591/Centricity/Domain/8983/2018%20Mathcounts_Chapter%20Competition%20Sprint%20Round.pdf), which is a 30-question test given over 40 minutes. 

# Meeting 4 - October 20, 2021

The meeting topic this week was [**Ratios and Area**](https://www.mathcounts.org/resources/ratios-and-area). Check out the video right here:

See you next week, October 27, for some probability!

# Meeting 3 - October 13, 2021

The meeting topic this week was [**The Fundamental Counting Principle**](https://www.mathcounts.org/resources/fundamental-counting-principle), which covered a lot of areas around how to count things. Check out the video right here:

See you next week, October 20, for the next meeting, where we will cover some geometry questions!

# Meeting 2 - October 6, 2021

We had some A/V issues but they'll be taken care of next time with some extra cables that I purchased. 

The meeting topic this week was [**Faster Arithmetic Methods**](https://www.mathcounts.org/resources/faster-arithmetic-methods), which covered a lot of tips for how you can make slight changes to a problem to make it easier to solve. 

Here's a great simple example: _find (363 + 709) + 637_. The parentheses are tricking you into wanting to add the two numbers first, but if you notice that 363 + 637 = 1000, then you can get the answer (1709) more quickly. 
* [Go here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPQ2_b_T0dE) for the video about Faster Arithmetic Methods (that we didn't have time to watch in the meeting. 
* [Go here](https://www.mathcounts.org/sites/default/files/Faster_Arithmetic_Methods_%28M%29.pdf) for the handout that was given out.
* [Go here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yfbfsex5l-ukYJSK-atGtIYrpotlCNFCSOidvFBtogM/edit?usp=sharing) for the complete slides that were covered in the meeting.

See you next week, October 13, for the next meeting!

# Meeting 1 - September 15, 2021

What a great initial meeting! I enjoyed meeting all of you and I hope you had fun. We spent a full hour doing countdown round-style math problems.

If you want to review the problems we did with solutions, [go here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cDkJovRiy-_L5imOTblBsryThZUgFzBmjkpvHHBTr4M/edit?usp=drivesdk). It includes a few more problems we didn't have time to get to.

**Remember - our next Math Club meeting isn't until October 6**. We will have consistent weekly sessions after that.
